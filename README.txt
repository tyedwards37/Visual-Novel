Project: Yippeech Visual Novel 
by Tyler Edwards 
FUTURE PROJECT

Description: Write and create a visual novel alongside my friend and artist Yippeech. The game will feature characters she designed, asoundtrack she created, a story written by both of us, and code implemented by me. 

Language: C#

Reason: I have worked alongsize Yippeech for a long time and they presented me with a few songs from the soundtrack. As soon as I heard them, I knew I wanted to be involved in the project both with the writing and the coding. This project also provided me an opportunity to work more with C# and creating on-screen visuals.

Plan: 
        1. Brainstorm storyline for the game.
        2. Code a very basic example visual novel with minimal choices, dialogue, and temporary sprites.
        3. Decide between a choice tree or a point system that will determine the direction the story goes in and the eventual ending.
        4. Finalize the overall storyline along with a timeline.
        5. Fledge out more of the code, with more branching options, real sprites, and proper dialogue.
        6. Create a proper title screen, setting tab, and ending screen.
        7. Incorporate the soundtrack and any sound effects that may assist in the storytelling. 
        8. Test the gameplay, specfically looking for ways to break it.
        9. Have a couple others beta test the game to ensure its soundness and make any needed adjustments. 
        10. Add any visual flare to the UI in order to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.
